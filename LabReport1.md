2. The working directory was `lecture1`.

**Path To A File** 

1. ![Image](LsP.png)
2. The working directory was `lecture1`.
3. The reason for why the output was a file `README` is because ls just prints out files and folders. Using the argument `ls README` it would just output the file name since `README` doesn't have any files nor folders as it's also not a directory.
4. The output was not an error.
