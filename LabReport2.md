1. The method that is called `handleRequest`.
2. The relevant arguments to the method is from the parameter `URI url`. Field `user` stores the second argument of the url(`jpolitz`), field `messages` stores the first argument of the url(`Hello`), the field `list` stores both `user and messages` in the wanted format, and the field `query` stores the whole url(`http://0-0-0-0-2214-fc9faraeal5eqdf00n7mfpga0o.us.edusercontent.com/add-message?s=Hello&user=jpolitz`)
3. Prior to the specific request all the fields were basically empty except `query` since it copies the url. After the specific request all the field's values now hold specific values that was just mentioned at 2.

## Part 3 

What I had learned from lab in week 3 is how to implement my own website without the use of much help, I learned a lot of functionalities on how URL's work, etc. I also got introduced into scp, mkdir, and ssh-keygen which gives you the ability to connect to remote devices without needing to input a password to log in.
