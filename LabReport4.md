> `vim <space> ListExamples.java` `<enter> e1 x i 2 :wq <enter>`
> vim is what gets you into the code so you can fix the issue, `e1` makes you jump to the last letter of the first word, `x` is what removes the bug, `i` is for insert and I inserted 2 to fix the issue, `:wq` is to save the changes. 

## This is Step 8

> `bash<space>test.sh<enter>`  The reason for why I did those commands is to see if my fix using vim had worked, and fixed the code so the bash script would pass all the tests.
